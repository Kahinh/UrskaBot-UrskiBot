# UrskaBot-UrskiBot

**DISCLAIMER :**
Bot can have some issues on Phone because the phone will try to add a space at the end of your last choice.
So in place of "Shock" your phone will try to push "Shock " and then it won't work. The issue comes from Discord. Not from the Bot itself.

**This bot extracts its data directly from the amazing websites:**
- https://dauntless-builder.fr/ by Medaey
- https://www.dauntless-builder.com/ by atomicptr

**Data about builds comes from:**
- [MetaSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-I4LQ_8uNqV9LuybXhz2wjmcPeTNNGWRZ-kFjsckwtk/edit#gid=0)
- [TrialSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kv3nlr7y5DJB_olhATqXXh-jPCkDygNCVyHkDwllTsc/edit)
Maintained by the Official Dauntless Community, mainly Nthngnss

Thanks to all of them to let me use their works/websites/data to run the bot.

__The Bot exists in two versions, one French and one English:__
- UrskaBot (EN) - [ADD THE EN BOT TO MY DISCORD](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=701147779199926373&permissions=294205323264&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
- UrskiBot (FR) - [ADD THE FR BOT TO MY DISCORD](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=923531479819112499&permissions=294205323264&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

UrskaBot / UrskiBot is the best solution to access Dauntless Meta Builds directly into Discord !

## TodoList:
There is still a lot to do, mainly to clean and optimize the bot. But I didn't plan any new major features to add into the bot, as the features already available are the ones I wanted to bring in.
